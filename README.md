# welcome to Raisfeld Encrypter!
this is an open-source project for encrypting
and decrypting files. it uses pycryptodome's
AES mode to encrypt files, and then uses PyQt6
to create a UI around that encryption.

## is this the complete version?
no, this is the _free_ version. it is
weak to brute-force attacks, contains
a bellow average UI, and I didn't
do a lot of testing, so there might still be
bugs. but. if this project goes well and i
see that I have a chance to create something
that can be useful and actually earn me money,
then I plan on making a new version, that will
have better UI, better security, and better
encryption.

## how to run the project?
in the current folder, there is a directory
called ```VENV```. by running 
```venv/Scripts/activate``` you activate
the environment and all modules needed for this
project. after that, you can just run
```src.main.py``` to start using the project.
if you want to run the project without using
the virtual environment, then ```start.py```
contains every module needed for the project,
just collect them and you can start using 
the project.
