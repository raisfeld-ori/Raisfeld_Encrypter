# this directory is for design only
the design is made using QtDesigner,
and then turned into PyQt6 code using ```pyuic6```.
to start working on the design, make sure you have PyQt6 installed, 
then, install the QtDesigner (https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download).
now, open the QtDesigner and load any .ui files. I hope the names
should explain what does each page do, but if they're not, then just open
and see.
