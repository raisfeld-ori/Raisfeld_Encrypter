# this is the website for the raisfeld-encrypter app

I thought making a normal static website to show the website would be
boring, but I didn't want to waste too much time on the website,
so I decided to learn sveltekit and how to use it for static websites.
since I wanted to focus on sveltekit and not on the design,
most of the design is just taken from the demo svelte app,
but i still changed the css a little bit so it's not a complete copy.
