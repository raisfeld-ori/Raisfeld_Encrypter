<h1>what's next?</h1>
<p>
    for now, i am not going to work on this project, <b>but</b>, if this project
    gets a lot of attraction, and i am going to create a new, paid version, with
    much better features than the current free version. the current app works great,
    but it doesn't have many things. it's just a system for encrypting, and decrypting
    files, so the new verison is going to have better encryption, better security,
    better UI, and so much more. if you have any features you want to add to the app,
    please contact <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox?compose=CllgCJNqtLBzvlXrqSvJQxQqntKBnLnPgdlhndnLBvkdPxrKQqgjsdQPsDqpnPwjsNzzfHZmXFL">
        ori.ri@chamam.org
    </a> so i can see them and add them to the paid version of raisfeld encrypter.
